☠️ ULTIMATE NETWORK KILLER v3.0
NetworkKiller v3.0 is a high-performance network packet generation and traffic analysis tool built with Python. Designed with a modern GUI and powerful backend engine, it provides users with real-time control and visibility over simulated traffic flows. Ideal for network diagnostics, educational demonstrations, and controlled stress testing in lab environments.

🔧 Key Features
🎯 Dual Attack Modes

UDP Flood: Sends rapid datagrams for connectionless testing.

SYN Flood: Crafts raw TCP packets to simulate half-open connections.

🧠 Smart Target Resolver
Automatically detects and resolves domain names to IP addresses for ease of use.

⚡ Thread-Optimized Engine
Launches up to 2000+ concurrent threads to simulate high-throughput environments.

🎭 Real IP Spoofing (Scapy-based)
Crafts packets with randomized source IPs for advanced simulation and spoofing demonstrations.
